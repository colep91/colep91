### CPSC 120

* Lab 8
    One of my favorite labs was Lab 8 part 2. In the lab, I had to take scores as command line arguments, verify the number of arguments, convert the strings to floats, and compute the average as well as printing out the result. I liked the lab because while the concepts seemed simple, I still had to trial and error with the computations, and I learned how important it is to really think about what you are doing.  
* Lab 4
    I found Lab 4 part 2 interesting as well. In the lab, we had to program a game in which a player would be trying to guess a predetermined secret number. The player would have 2 guesses, and if they were incorrect the program would tell them that they are either too high or too low. The lab was engaging to me because I had to learn that you have to prepare for more test cases than you initially realize to write an effective program.  
* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 2, was another one of my favorite labs. We had to take a double as an input to represent a length in feet and convert it to feet and inches. The lab required us to convert different value types many different times and I had to learn how to use the trunc() function to deal with the different type
